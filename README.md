##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ with npm/pnpm
- **Python** 3.8+ with pip
- **Git** for version control

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Trail
```

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export MODEL_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here  # Linux/Mac
# OR
set MODEL_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here     # Windows

# Start the server
python app.py
```

**Alternative startup methods:**
```bash
# Using development utility
python dev.py start

# Using Windows batch script
scripts\start_server.bat
```

**Backend running at:** `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
# OR
pnpm install

# Create environment file
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here" >> .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
# OR
pnpm dev
```

**Frontend running at:** `http://localhost:3000`

## Health Prediction Models

### 1. Heart Disease Prediction
- **Input**: 11 clinical parameters (age, sex, chest pain type, BP, cholesterol, ECG, etc.)
- **Model**: SVM classifier trained on cardiac dataset
- **Output**: Risk level, confidence score, and cardiac condition sub-predictions

### 2. Diabetes Prediction  
- **Input**: 8 clinical parameters (pregnancies, glucose, BMI, insulin, etc.)
- **Model**: SVM classifier trained on PIMA diabetes dataset
- **Output**: Risk assessment with diabetes type sub-predictions

### 3. Parkinson's Disease Prediction
- **Input**: 16 vocal biomarkers (MDVP frequency, jitter, shimmer, etc.)
- **Model**: SVM classifier using acoustic feature analysis
- **Output**: Neurological risk assessment with motor symptom analysis

### 4. Common Diseases Prediction
- **Input**: Symptom selection, duration, severity, demographics
- **Models**: Dual model system (Logistic Regression + Neural Network)
- **Output**: Disease prediction with confidence-based model selection

## API Endpoints

### Core Prediction Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Auth Required | Description |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `/predict/heart` | POST | ‚úÖ API Key | Heart disease risk assessment |
| `/predict/diabetes` | POST | ‚úÖ API Key | Diabetes risk prediction |
| `/predict/parkinsons` | POST | ‚úÖ API Key | Parkinson's disease analysis |
| `/predict/common` | POST | ‚úÖ API Key | Common diseases diagnosis |
| `/health` | GET | ‚ùå None | Server and model health check |

### API Documentation
- **Interactive Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- **API Key Authentication** - All prediction endpoints protected
- **CORS Protection** - Configured for specific origins
- **Input Validation** - Pydantic models validate all inputs
- **Rate Limiting** - Implement in production (recommended)

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Use strong, randomly generated API keys
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and request throttling
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd server

# Test model loading
python dev.py test-models

# Test API endpoints (requires running server)
python dev.py test-api

# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend

# Type checking
npm run build

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Development

### Adding New Prediction Models

1. **Train your ML model** and save to `Datasets/pkl/`
2. **Update model loader** in `server/models/loader.py`
3. **Create input mapper** in `server/models/mappers.py`
4. **Add API endpoint** in `server/app.py`
5. **Create frontend form** in `frontend/components/forms/`

### Custom Styling

The project uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Radix UI** for accessible components
- **Custom glassmorphism** effects
